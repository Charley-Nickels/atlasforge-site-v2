# Notes – UI Icons and Frames v01

## Aesthetic Assumptions
- **Tone:** The goal is a professional creative workstation with a hint of sci‑fi. The color palette leans towards cool blues and teals complemented by occasional warm accents (orange) for emphasis. The backgrounds use dark navy and desaturated purples to evoke focus and depth.
- **Iconography:** Icons are simple and flat to allow recoloring via CSS. They avoid heavy gradients or shadows for flexibility. Icons share the same 24×24 viewbox to maintain consistency.
- **Padding and Corners:** Frames use a corner radius of 8 px and 2 px border strokes to give a subtle softness without appearing cartoonish. Headers within panels are highlighted with a slightly lighter shade.
- **Scalability:** All assets are vector (SVG). They can be resized freely and styled with fills, strokes, or CSS filters.

## Future Considerations
- The icon set can be expanded in later runs to include additional file types (scripts, assets, images, audio).
- Colors can be tuned to match the final AtlasForge branding once the design system is finalized.
- If the creative directors desire, a light theme variation can be produced in Run 5.
