## What is AtlasForge
Title: "What is AtlasForge?"
Body: "AtlasForge is a cohesive ecosystem for shipping governed, lore-safe products. Atlas-V keeps canon honest, AtlasStudio ships the work, and AtlasWave, OIA, and Decision Console prove the loop."

## Methodology
Title: "The governance loop"
Body: "Brief, generate, validate, and ship. Every step is wrapped in glow cues so teams know which system they’re touching."
Points:
- Briefs originate in AtlasStudio using canon-safe templates.
- Atlas-V validates prompts and files against canon.
- Decisions are logged in the console with ready-to-ship diffs.
- Releases hit OIA, AtlasWave, or other experiences with the same glow language.
