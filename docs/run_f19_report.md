# Phase 7 — Run F19 Report (Page Template Construction)

## Summary
- Built Phase 7 page template specifications for all primary AtlasForge pages, mapping section order, component families, responsive rules, cross-brand hooks, and placeholder treatments for future components.
- Established Figma expectations including auto-layout, grid alignment, and multi-frame coverage (desktop/tablet/mobile) without touching site visuals or runtime code.

## Pages Covered
- Home, Atlas-V, AtlasStudio, Games, OIA, SKB, Media, Labs, About, Admin

## Template Construction Highlights
- Each template now lists canonical section order, mapped components, responsive grid behavior, CTA treatment, and cross-brand governance hooks where applicable.
- Placeholder blocks called out for About timeline/lore and Admin export/timeline needs; Admin supports table vs card presentation based on pending decision.
- Governance badge placements standardized per template references; CTA clusters remain dual-CTA capable unless F19 decision closes to primary-only.

## F19 — New Decisions Surfaced
- **P6-F19-001 (CTA Standardization):** Decide whether hero sections should enforce single primary CTA across brands or keep dual CTA support.
- **P6-F19-002 (About Placeholder Treatment):** Determine if About timeline/lore placeholder should render as timeline bar or neutral content block in Figma.
- **P6-F19-003 (Media vs Labs Layout):** Confirm whether Media and Labs card layouts should share a unified template or retain separate variants.

## Integrity Check
- No HTML/CSS/JS or assets modified; documentation-only updates.
- Tokens unchanged; phase canon from Runs F1–F18 preserved.
