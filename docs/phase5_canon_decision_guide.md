# Phase 5 Canon Decision Guide (Business Questions)

This guide explains how to use the AtlasForge Decision Console to finalize the Phase 5 canonical structure of the company, brands, subsidiaries, and public-facing identity.

Sections correspond directly to decision blocks in the console:
- Core Pillars (A–E scale)
- Brand Roles
- Subsidiary Approvals (Approve/Deny)
- Governance Transparency Levels
- Homepage + Navigation Structure (A–E)

After making selections:
1. Export JSON  
2. Return that JSON to the Master Architect (ChatGPT)  
3. Phase 5 rewrite will begin
