# Playground Restore Run Report

## Files Changed
- `atlasstudio.html` – Restored pre-Phase 5 conceptual sections, added multi-tab shell mock, ghost sidecar, and cozy workstation framing.
- `atlasstudio/playground.html` – Reintroduced tab rail, faux-terminal feed, and supportive sidebar stack alongside the tri-panel simulation.
- `styles/atlasstudio.css` – Added shell, tab, terminal, and sidebar styling for restored conceptual UI surfaces.

## Elements Restored
- Multi-tab conceptual mock spanning Game, Excel, Policy, Writing, and Web rails.
- Tri-panel workstation with task drawer, focus panel, and assistant/snapshot rail.
- Faux-terminal / Codex ghost sidecar with Atlas-V callouts.
- Task drawer and workflow preview chips reflecting Navigator + Guard oversight.
- Cozy workstation block with project tree, mock file cards, and concept action buttons.
- Conceptual diagram placeholders for tab switches, Guard overlays, and FlowSim pulses.
- Cross-brand wiring notes for Atlas-V, AtlasForge Games, SKB, and Labs handoffs.

## Updated Canon + Tone Decisions
- Tone remains cozy/supportive with soft gradients and encouraging microcopy.
- Atlas-V presence is noted as gentle guidance; Playground remains non-production and front-end only.
- Coming-soon posture preserved; contact routes remain footer-only.

## Conflicts or Notes
- All restored surfaces stay non-functional; no backend or data storage exists.
- Placeholder diagrams are ready to swap with Phase 6 Figma components.
