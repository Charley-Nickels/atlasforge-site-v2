# Summary – Home Page Glow Mock v01

**Deliverable overview:** In Run 5, we created a high‑end homepage mockup that synthesises the updated **glow sphere pack** and **theme tokens v02** into a cohesive design. The deliverables include:

- **home_mock_desktop.png** – a full desktop mock showing the hero section, product tiles row and footer on a 1600×1200 px canvas.
- **home_mock_mobile.png** – a mobile version (750×1600 px) with vertically stacked elements optimised for small screens.
- **hero_section.png** – a standalone slice of the hero area, illustrating the glow panel, gradient border and CTA button.
- **product_tiles_row.png** – a horizontal row of three product cards with glow backgrounds.
- **footer_glow.png** – a self‑contained footer component with halo bar and ambient glows.
- **home_layout_notes.md** – detailed commentary explaining each section and the design rationale.
- **how_to_integrate_HOME_PAGE_GLOW_MOCK_v01.md** – guidance for implementing the layouts with HTML/CSS and the glow assets.
- **notes_HOME_PAGE_GLOW_MOCK_v01.md** – observations, assumptions and further considerations.

**Design rationale:** The mockups emphasise a premium, cinematic feel that aligns with the AtlasForge identity. Ambient glow spheres are layered behind panels and cards to evoke the brand’s *magenta energy core* and *orbit lines* described in the AtlasForge canon【923854715267635†L17-L49】. Colour accents for products follow the palette defined in `theme_tokens_v02.json`. Soft gradients, rounded corners and subtle translucency convey sophistication without resorting to gimmicky neon effects. The hero section anchors the message with a bold tagline, while the product tiles introduce the core offerings. A halo bar in the footer acts as a graceful transition and supports the “systems with soul” theme.

These assets are ready for Codex to translate into responsive HTML/CSS components. The design will serve as a reference for future refinement and integration into the AtlasForge website.
