# AtlasForge Products

## AtlasForge (Platform)
AtlasForge is the connective tissue for everything we ship – brand governance, canon awareness, and the glow-driven visual system that keeps every surface coherent.

## Atlas-V
Atlas-V is the governance copilot. It enforces canon, flags risky prompts, and keeps decisions linked to the right characters, episodes, and lore.

## AtlasStudio
AtlasStudio is the creator workstation. It blends file operations, Atlas-V actions, and a conversational copilot for patching, organizing, and summarizing work.

## Octopus in Action
Octopus in Action is the showcase game, proof that the governance loop can stay cozy and player-first while still staying on canon.

## Decision Console
The Decision Console is the reviewer’s cockpit. It surfaces queues, flags, and canonical merges so producers can sign off quickly and confidently.

## AtlasWave
AtlasWave is the audio wing – atmospheric beds, stems, and cues that sync with worlds and state packs.
