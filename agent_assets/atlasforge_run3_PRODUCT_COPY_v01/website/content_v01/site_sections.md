### Hero tagline variations

Choose one of these short taglines for the hero section of the home page.  Each aligns with the AtlasForge tone—professional, modern and imaginative:

1. **Systems with Soul**
2. **Workflows Meet Worlds**
3. **Build, Simulate, Live**
4. **Tools That Tell Stories**

### What is AtlasForge?

AtlasForge is a studio and stack built around one simple idea: your tools should feel as alive as the worlds you create.  We develop a family of products—from the **Atlas‑V engine** and **AtlasStudio workstation** to worlds like **Octopus in Action**—that treat workflows, routing and sound the way a game treats physics.  Instead of separate, one‑off interfaces, AtlasForge offers a unified language and geometry that ties your tasks, diagrams and narratives together.  It’s the umbrella brand for a future where design, simulation and storytelling share the same playground.

### Feature lists

#### AtlasForge Interactive (umbrella)

- Unified geometry language ties brands, tools and worlds together.
- Magenta energy core and orbit lines create a cohesive visual identity.
- Bridges spreadsheets, design logs and half‑finished concepts into a single stack.
- Serves as the navigation layer across Studio, Engine, Worlds and Consoles.

#### Atlas‑V Engine

- **Navigator, Memory, Guard & FlowSim** modules describe how work moves and stays safe.
- Built‑in concurrency and versioning ensure consistency across complex projects.
- Simulation‑ready: run what‑if scenarios and rewind flows without breaking anything.
- Shared vocabulary for tools, worlds and consoles; no more bespoke engines per product.

#### AtlasStudio Workstation

- Three‑panel layout for queues, actions and snapshots keeps context at hand.
- Drag‑and‑drop modules: plug in diagrams, audio palettes or editors.
- Live integration with Atlas‑V for real‑time feedback on flows and risks.
- Designed for storytellers, producers and engineers alike.

#### Octopus in Action

- Harbour‑city simulation where tasks become stories and systems become characters.
- Dynamic loops: each decision sends ripples through the world via Atlas‑V.
- Multi‑branch narrative inspired by the octopus motif; every tentacle tells a story.
- Test bed for new features like AtlasWave and Decision Console integration.

#### Decision Console

- Centralised dashboard for monitoring workflows, risks and trade‑offs.
- Run simulations and adjust parameters in real time to explore alternatives.
- Integrates with AtlasStudio for seamless hand‑off between planning and execution.
- Collaborative: multiple stakeholders can review and approve decisions together.

#### AtlasWave (experimental)

- Reactive audio engine that responds to the state of your project.
- Mix loops, stems and ambient palettes directly in AtlasStudio.
- Harmonises with OIA and other worlds to create immersive soundtracks.
- Built on Atlas‑V to maintain sync between audio and simulation.

### Coming soon messages

#### Decision Console

The Decision Console is in development and will soon enter closed testing.  We’re building a command bridge that lets you visualise loops, run simulations and adjust priorities on the fly.  Join our mailing list to be the first to try it.

#### AtlasWave

AtlasWave is still experimental—but its possibilities are endless.  We’re exploring how to make audio palettes that react to your workflows and worlds.  Sign up to hear the first notes and help shape the way AtlasForge sounds.
