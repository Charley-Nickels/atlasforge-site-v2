# Phase 5 Canon Decision Guide — Business Questionnaire

This console is Step 0 for Phase 5. Unlock Goblin Mode, review each block once, export the JSON, and paste it back to the Master Architect (ChatGPT/Copilot) to trigger the rewrite.

## How to use
1. Unlock Goblin Mode.
2. Review each block (1–12) and make a single choice per question.
3. Export JSON and send it back to the architect.

## What the blocks decide
- **Core pillars visibility:** How prominently AtlasForge, Atlas-V, AtlasStudio, Games, Media, Labs, Merch, Contact, Governance, and Roadmap appear across the site.
- **Brand roles & importance:** Flagship vs. support roles for AtlasForge, Atlas-V, AtlasStudio, games, SKB, media, docs/library, academy, and consulting.
- **Brand tone & voice:** Voice and tone for the umbrella, Atlas-V, AtlasStudio, games, OIA, SKB, media, governance, contact, and learning materials.
- **Atlas-V behavior & messaging:** Proactivity, governance language, public lore (Council/Engine), Atlas-V Lite visibility, safety posture, and human oversight emphasis.
- **AtlasStudio surface & scope:** Whether Studio is current/pilot/future, demo fidelity, access rules, workflow depth, pricing hints, and collaboration framing.
- **Website structure & navigation:** Which top-level pages exist, grouping of products, depth of games/media/governance pages, roadmap placement, footer density, and hiding admin links.
- **Homepage content blocks:** Which sections show (stack diagram, games, tools, media, governance, worlds, merch, CTAs, testimonials, news) and how detailed they are.
- **Subsidiaries & lines:** Approve, deny, backlog, or explore expansions like MerchForge, TemplateFactory, Hypercasual Forge, Academy, Docs/Library, Consulting, Media Studio, sound packs, Publishing, creator portal, events, podcast network, Labs, collab drops, and Press.
- **Games & IP status:** Public framing for OIA, Neighborhood Watch, runners, sims, audio games, visualization demos, mobile spin-offs, world expansions, Studio demos, collab titles, backlog/retired concepts, mod support, and release cadence.
- **Media lines & focus:** Priority of true crime, engineering education, devlogs, podcasting, comedy/sketch, livestreams, soundtrack breakdowns, docuseries, world bibles, research notes, community highlights, and media cadence.
- **Governance & boundaries:** Transparency level, Atlas-V explainer, policy access, release notes, admin visibility, Council lore, risk/safety discussion, internal tool naming, user data handling, escalation visibility, and feedback loops.
- **Collaboration & contact policy:** Openness, placement, intake rigor, hiring visibility, world collab invites, media requests, pilot recruitment, response expectations, and which channels are listed.

## Remember
- Every item is multiple choice; defaults are middle-ground.
- Many prompts are optional expansions you can approve, deny, backlog, or explore.
- Export the JSON once after making choices—this powers the Phase 5 rewrite.
