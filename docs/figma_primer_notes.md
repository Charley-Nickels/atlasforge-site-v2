# AtlasForge Site V2 — Figma Primer Notes (Phase 6 Handoff)

These notes summarize tone, required sections, components, spacing, and cross-brand rules finalized during Phase 5. Apply them directly when building Figma components and page wires.

## AtlasForge (Umbrella)
- **Tone:** Balanced, confident.
- **Sections:** Umbrella hero, ecosystem/stack diagram, philosophy/values, cross-brand overview.
- **Components:** Hero (logo + badge + dual CTA), stack diagram module, section headers, CTA chips, footer teaser for merch/contact.
- **Spacing/Hierarchy:** Standard hero rhythm (48/32/24), max-width container 1080–1160px, cards use 16px internal padding and 12px gaps.
- **Cross-Brand Rules:** Display “Powered by Atlas-V” framing inside stack diagram; reference AtlasStudio workflow and Games/OIA in overview.

## Atlas-V (Engine)
- **Tone:** Serious, technical.
- **Sections:** Project Copilot intro, operating modes, oversight/safety blurbs, micro-FAQ, designer notes for workflows.
- **Components:** Hero with technical badge, mode cards, FAQ accordion/list, governance-safe info block, CTA row.
- **Spacing/Hierarchy:** Hero uses standard rhythm; cards with 14–16px padding; badge row under hero for “Powered by Atlas-V”.
- **Cross-Brand Rules:** Atlas-V badge appears on AtlasStudio, Games, and OIA heroes; governance blurbs stay light and public-safe.

## AtlasStudio (Workstation)
- **Tone:** Cozy, supportive.
- **Sections:** Tab overview (Game/Excel/Policy/Writing/Web), Day in the Studio scenario, Studio Personality, conceptual diagrams, Coming Soon CTA.
- **Components:** Tab list mock, diagram placeholders, cozy hero with soft badge, secondary CTA for notify/coming soon.
- **Spacing/Hierarchy:** Keep softer spacing (40/28/20) with rounded cards; ensure microcopy stays warm.
- **Cross-Brand Rules:** “Built in AtlasStudio workflow” references for Games and Labs prototypes; powered-by badge from Atlas-V near hero subtitle.

## Games Label
- **Tone:** Playful + professional.
- **Sections:** Games hero, Our Game Philosophy, OIA flagship callout, Concept Vault (Neighborhood Watch, Sim Management, Viz Sim), designer notes.
- **Components:** Game cards, philosophy block, cross-brand badges (Powered by Atlas-V / Built in AtlasStudio / Audio by SKB where relevant).
- **Spacing/Hierarchy:** Hero rhythm consistent with umbrella; cards align to 3-up desktop, 1-up mobile.
- **Cross-Brand Rules:** AtlasForge Games badge plus Atlas-V + SKB credits on OIA tiles; concept vault avoids over-promising (limit to three highlighted concepts pre-Figma).

## Octopus in Action (OIA)
- **Tone:** Playful, crisp.
- **Sections:** Hero with transparent OIA logo, short overview, species block + Mayor Octavius intro, screenshot gallery placeholders, development status (In Progress), audio credit.

## Media Line
- **Tone:** Balanced.
- **Sections:** True Crime pillar, Engineering/Education pillar, optional Commentary, seasonal cadence, coming-soon framing.
- **Components:** Media cards with tag + runtime/status, light CTA row, pillar descriptors.

- **Cross-Brand Rules:** Tie-ins to Labs for experiments that graduate; keep governance messaging off this page.

## Labs
- **Tone:** Experimental.
- **Sections:** Lab categories (Narrative, Prototype, Tools, Chaos), concept vault entries, graduation pipeline from experiment → product.
- **Components:** Labs cards with tone tags (experimental/chaotic/narrative/prototype), status pills, graduation steps list.
- **Spacing/Hierarchy:** Maintain grid rhythm; cards may be 2–3 columns desktop, 1 column mobile.
- **Cross-Brand Rules:** Mark experiments that feed AtlasStudio and Games; badges for “Experiment from Labs.”

## Merch
