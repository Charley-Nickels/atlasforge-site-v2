# Home Page Glow Mock v01 – Section by Section

This document breaks down the **home page mock** into its key sections, describing the intent behind each element and how the glow aesthetic supports the AtlasForge identity.

## Hero Section

The hero is the focal point of the page. It uses a dark gradient background and layered *glow spheres* (magenta, cyan and purple) to create depth and a cinematic mood. A rounded dark panel sits on top, inspired by the **hero‑panel glow frame** from the glow sphere pack. Around this panel, a thin gradient border shifts from magenta to cyan to purple, echoing AtlasForge’s energetic palette. The primary tagline “**Systems with Soul**” is displayed in large, bold type to emphasise the company vision, while a subheading (“Tools and worlds in harmony”) reinforces the message. The call‑to‑action button (“Get Notified”) uses a horizontal gradient from magenta to cyan and rounded corners. Overall, this section sets the tone with energy and polish.

## Explore Our Stack – Product Tiles

Below the hero, a dark section introduces the product suite. A subtle vertical gradient differentiates this area from the hero above. The heading **“Explore Our Stack”** invites visitors to browse the products. Three horizontally aligned cards represent Atlas‑V (engine & language), AtlasStudio (creative workstation) and Octopus in Action (harbour‑city world). Each card is coloured using its product’s accent colour (green, violet, orange) from the theme tokens. A faint glow sphere sits behind each card to give a lift and depth. Inside the cards, a light translucent overlay creates a glass‑card feel, while rounded corners match the hero panel. Text labels are concise: product name in bold and a short descriptor beneath it.

## Footer

The footer provides a calm conclusion. A gradient transitions from a mid‑tone navy to a deeper blue, matching the brand’s dark foundation. At the top of the footer, a **halo bar** runs across the width of the page, transitioning from teal through green to gold; this bar acts as a visual divider and hints at the “energy continuum” of the AtlasForge brand. Large, faint glow spheres (teal and gold) sit in the left and right corners to balance the composition. The copyright line is set in small type and uses the text‑secondary colour. This footer is designed to feel minimal yet rich, with subtle ambient lighting instead of heavy ornamentation.

## Mobile Layout Differences

On mobile, elements are stacked vertically to respect narrow screens. The hero panel remains full‑width with glows repositioned around it. Product cards are stacked one after another, each occupying the full width minus safe‑area margins. The halo bar remains at the top of the footer, and glows are resized to maintain balance. The typography sizes are scaled down appropriately, ensuring readability on small devices. The overall hierarchy is preserved while maintaining comfortable spacing and a premium feel.
