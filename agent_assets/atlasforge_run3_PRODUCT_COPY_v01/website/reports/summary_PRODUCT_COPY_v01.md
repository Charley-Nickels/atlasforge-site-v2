# Summary – Product Copy (Run 3)

This document summarises the content created in Run 3 for the AtlasForge website.  The goal of this run was to craft product blurbs, hero taglines, descriptive paragraphs and feature lists that align with the brand’s professional yet imaginative tone.

## Files produced

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `website/content_v01/product_blurbs.md` | Contains 80–150‑word blurbs for AtlasForge Interactive, Atlas‑V Engine, AtlasStudio Workstation, Octopus in Action, Decision Console and the experimental AtlasWave. |
| `website/content_v01/site_sections.md` | Provides hero tagline variations, a concise “What is AtlasForge?” paragraph, feature lists for each product and “coming soon” messages for Decision Console and AtlasWave. |
| `website/reports/how_to_integrate_PRODUCT_COPY_v01.md` | Instructions for integrating the copy into the website codebase and CMS. |
| `website/reports/notes_PRODUCT_COPY_v01.md` | Notes on tone, assumptions and future adjustments. |

## Highlights

* **Brand‑aligned blurbs:** Each product blurb emphasises the shared geometry language and modular systems that tie the AtlasForge family together.  The blurbs remain concise (100–140 words) and professional, focusing on benefits rather than jargon.
* **Hero taglines:** Four short, memorable taglines (“Systems with Soul”, “Workflows Meet Worlds”, “Build, Simulate, Live”, “Tools That Tell Stories”) give flexibility for the hero section of the home page.
* **What is AtlasForge?** The explanatory paragraph succinctly defines AtlasForge as a studio and stack where tools and worlds share the same playground, reinforcing the brand narrative.
* **Feature lists:** Bullet points outline key capabilities for each product, aiding quick scanning and future UI implementations (e.g. in cards or info panels).
* **Coming soon:** Short announcements for the Decision Console and AtlasWave set expectations and encourage sign‑ups.

These content assets will inform the next stage of the website build and provide Codex with the wording needed to populate the pages designed in Run 2.
