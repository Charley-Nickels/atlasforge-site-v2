# Summary – Layout Concepts (Run 2)

This document summarises the deliverables for Run 2 of Agent Forge, whose objective was to create high‑level layout concepts for the AtlasForge website using the theme tokens defined in Run 1.

## Delivered layouts

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `website/layouts_v01/home_page_layout.png` | A conceptual wireframe for the **Home page**.  It features a dark navigation bar, a hero section with tagline and call‑to‑action, a product highlights section showing four colour‑coded tiles (Atlas‑V, AtlasStudio, Octopus in Action and Loop), a methodology/philosophy section, a secondary call‑to‑action and a footer. |
| `website/layouts_v01/product_page_layout.png` | A layout for an **Atlas‑V product page**.  It retains the global header and footer, uses the product’s green palette for the hero and call‑to‑action sections, and includes an overview area and a three‑column features section. |
| `website/layouts_v01/nav_header_footer_layout.png` | A focused view of the **navigation/header and footer system**.  It demonstrates the arrangement of navigation links with an accent underline on the active item and a concise footer with copyright notice. |

## Component mockups

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `website/components_v01/component_product_tiles.png` | A reusable **product tile component**.  Each tile uses the product’s accent colour, rounded corners and a space for a tagline. |
| `website/components_v01/component_section_divider.png` | A **section divider bar** created with a horizontal gradient between the AtlasForge cyan and gold accents.  It can separate sections on long pages. |
| `website/components_v01/component_hero_banner_frame.png` | A **hero banner frame** with a coloured border and dark interior that can host hero copy or imagery. |
| `website/components_v01/component_coming_soon.png` | A **“Coming Soon” block** using the Loop teal accent colour and space for explanatory text. |

## Design rationale

* **Consistency with theme tokens** – The layouts use the dark backgrounds, secondary surfaces, accent colours and rounded radii from Run 1.  Each product retains its own colour identity while fitting within the overall palette.
* **Section hierarchy** – The wireframes establish clear zones (header, hero, highlights, methodology, CTA, footer) with generous spacing.  This helps guide the user through the narrative of the page.
* **Product differentiation** – By giving each product its own accent colour, the highlights section and product pages feel distinct.  The Atlas‑V page uses green, while the other tile examples hint at purple (AtlasStudio), orange (Octopus in Action) and teal (Loop).
* **Simple components** – The optional components (tiles, dividers, frames, coming‑soon block) are meant as building blocks for the site.  They show how to apply colours, spacing and radii consistently.

## Next steps

These layouts serve as guides rather than final designs.  In later stages Codex (or Agent Studio) should translate these concepts into responsive web pages using CSS and the theme tokens.  The copywriting phase (Run 3) will provide the content to populate these sections.
