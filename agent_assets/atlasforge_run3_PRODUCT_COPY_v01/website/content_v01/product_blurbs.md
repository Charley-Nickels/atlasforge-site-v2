### AtlasForge Interactive (Umbrella Brand)

AtlasForge Interactive is the hub where our tools, engine, and worlds converge.  We treat workflows, routing and sound the way a game treats physics: as systems that should feel consistent no matter where you touch them.  At its core is a magenta energy source, orbit lines and clean geometry that tie the family together.  From this centre, we build a workstation (AtlasStudio), a language (Atlas‑V), immersive worlds like **Octopus in Action**, and specialised consoles.  AtlasForge is more than a studio – it’s a playground for stacks that don’t yet exist, a place where spreadsheets, simulations and storyboards share the same canvas.

### Atlas‑V Engine

Atlas‑V is the protocol that keeps your work moving and safe.  It isn’t just an engine; it’s a language that describes how tasks flow, pause, branch, and resolve.  With modules like **Navigator**, **Memory**, **Guard** and **FlowSim**, Atlas‑V provides a shared vocabulary for worlds, tools and decision systems.  It handles concurrency, versioning and risk so your projects remain consistent across time and space.  Use it to build branching workflows, simulate what‑if scenarios, or power complex in‑game economies.  Atlas‑V lets you design sophisticated systems without losing sight of the people and stories inside them.

### AtlasStudio Workstation

AtlasStudio is your creative cockpit.  It presents a three‑panel interface for queues, actions and snapshots, letting you manage tasks, routes and experiments from one place.  Built on top of Atlas‑V, the workstation treats every action as part of a bigger story: drag a clip into your pipeline, tweak a parameter, and see the effects ripple across your project.  AtlasStudio is not just a dashboard; it’s a living workspace where simulations, audio palettes and world editors plug in as modules.  Whether you’re planning a story arc or debugging a stack, AtlasStudio keeps your thinking organised and your context intact.

### Octopus in Action

Octopus in Action is our flagship world: a harbour‑city simulation where flows turn into stories.  In OIA you’ll explore docks, towers and markets while managing loops of work, resources and narrative.  Characters and tasks are bound together by the Atlas‑V engine, so every decision has consequences that cascade through the city.  The octopus motif isn’t just for show – each tentacle represents a different branch of the story, and you can watch them weave together as you play.  OIA is more than a game: it’s a proving ground for our methodology, a living demonstration of how systems with soul can emerge from clean, modular design.

### Decision Console

The Decision Console is a command bridge for complex projects.  Powered by Atlas‑V, it provides a clear view into your workflows, risks and trade‑offs.  Visualise decision loops, run what‑if simulations, and adjust parameters in real time.  The console unifies dashboards, alerting and control panels in a single interface so that designers, producers and stakeholders can make informed choices together.  Whether you’re orchestrating a live event or balancing an economy, the Decision Console helps you weigh competing priorities without losing your narrative thread.  Coming soon to the AtlasForge family.

### AtlasWave (Experimental)

AtlasWave is an exploration into reactive sound.  Built as an extension of the Atlas‑V engine and integrated into AtlasStudio, it generates and mixes audio palettes that respond to your workflows.  Think of it as an audio lab: craft loops, stems and soundscapes that evolve with the state of your project.  AtlasWave will let worlds like OIA breathe through ambient music and dynamic effects while giving creators fine‑grained control over tone.  This tool is still taking shape but promises to bring a new dimension to the AtlasForge stack.
