# Phase 6 — Run F5 Report (Wireframe Generation Initialization)

## Summary
- Generated refreshed lo-fi wireframes for all primary pages with section order, component mappings, content length guidance, responsive notes, and ASCII layout flows.
- Documented cross-brand touchpoints and Figma handoff cues aligned to Phase 6 component and token dictionaries without altering site visuals.
- Confirmed no HTML, CSS, JS, or token changes were made; this run is documentation-only.

## Wireframe Files Created/Updated
- docs/figma/wireframes/home.md
- docs/figma/wireframes/atlasv.md
- docs/figma/wireframes/atlasstudio.md
- docs/figma/wireframes/games.md

- docs/figma/wireframes/admin.md

## Patterns & Notes
- Common hero → grid/list → CTA/footers sequencing captured via ASCII flow blocks for rapid Figma framing.
- Reusable 3→2→1 grid degradation noted across product, media, game, lab, and SKB layouts with CTA stacks on mobile.
- AtlasStudio wireframe isolates playground shell, tab strip, console, and drawer as detachable frames; admin wireframe clarifies table vs card mobile options.

## Component Mapping Completeness
- Each section references components from Runs F2–F4 (heroes, cards, galleries, Atlas-V safety block, AtlasStudio shell elements, admin console scaffolding).
- PlaceholderBlocks remain where bespoke widgets may emerge (admin table, policy download slot, lore/timeline blocks) but are tied to existing patterns.

## F5 — New Decisions Surfaced
- **P6-F5-001 (Responsive/Interaction):** Decide whether games screenshot gallery should prototype as a carousel on mobile or remain a single-column scroll.
- **P6-F5-002 (Responsive/Structure):** Determine if the admin decision list should ship as a responsive table with horizontal scroll or swap to stacked cards on mobile.
- **P6-F5-003 (Brand/Badge):** Confirm consistent placement of Atlas-V governance badges across Home, Atlas-V, Media, and OIA hero and footer governance touchpoints.
- **P6-F5-004 (Component Variant):** Clarify whether the AtlasStudio task drawer needs a minimized/peek state in wireframes or only the full-height variant.

## Integrity Check
- No HTML, CSS, or JS changes performed.
- No design tokens altered.
- Output confined to documentation updates and this report.
