# Glow Usage Guidelines
- Use glow utility classes to add accent light only on key surfaces: hero, CTAs, and card edges.
- Pair dark panels (#0b0d18–#13172b) with vibrant glows from brand colors.
- Prefer soft radial gradients behind orbs and subtle halo bars between sections.
- Keep text on high-contrast backgrounds; avoid placing body text directly on bright glows.
- Frame important modules with a 1px inner stroke and a diffused outer shadow.
