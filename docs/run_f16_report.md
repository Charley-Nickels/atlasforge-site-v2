# Phase 7 — Run F16 Report (Advanced Systems)

## Summary
- Documented gallery system specs (Games, OIA, Media) covering purpose, anatomy, variants, states, responsive behavior, interaction patterns, and token usage for Phase 7 Figma builds.
- Captured SKB audio list system specs with track/playlist variants, state model, responsive rules, token hooks, and interaction flow guidance.
- Defined Atlas-V governance modules (badge sizes and governance card) with placement rules, cross-brand usage, tooltip triggers, states, and token references.

## System Completeness Validation
- All advanced systems in scope (gallery, audio list, governance) include anatomy, variants, states, responsive guidance, interaction notes, and token mapping.
- Interaction behaviors align with Phase 6 F8–F10 matrices and Phase 7 token/style naming for Figma readiness.

## F16 — New Decisions Surfaced
- None new; existing decisions on mobile gallery gestures and governance tooltip triggers remain referenced (P6-F5-001/P6-F8-001/P6-F10-001 and P6-F11-002/P6-F8-004/P6-F10-004).

## References to Prior Canon
- Responsive rules match Phase 6 layout and wireframe patterns (3→2→1, 2→1 stacks) and Phase 7 token-to-style mappings.
- Governance placement and triggers respect prior decision hooks (P6-F5-003 and P6-F11-002).

## Integrity Check
- No HTML, CSS, JS, or visual assets modified.
- Documentation-only changes confined to Figma component specs and this report.
