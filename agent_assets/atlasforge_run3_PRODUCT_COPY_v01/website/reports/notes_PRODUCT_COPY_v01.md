# Notes & Assumptions – Product Copy

## Tone and style

The copy was written to feel **professional**, **modern** and **clean**, in line with the AtlasForge brand canon.  We avoided marketing hyperbole and instead focused on clear explanations of each product’s purpose and benefits.  Words like “engine”, “workstation”, “simulation” and “stack” were chosen deliberately to convey a sense of robust technology, while phrases such as “systems with soul” nod to the creative, playful side of the brand.

## Source material

Much of the inspiration came from the current AtlasForge About page on octopusinaction.app【923854715267635†L7-L45】, which describes the umbrella identity and the relationships between AtlasStudio, Atlas‑V, Octopus in Action and other tools.  We extended these concepts into coherent blurbs and feature lists.  Where the public pages lacked detail (e.g. Decision Console, AtlasWave), we extrapolated based on the existing brand themes (shared language, modular systems, interplay between tools and worlds).

## Length constraints

Each product blurb is kept between 100–140 words to satisfy the requested 80–150‑word range.  This length allows us to convey enough detail without overwhelming the reader.  For future iterations we can trim or expand copy depending on layout requirements.

## Unbuilt tools

The Decision Console and AtlasWave are noted as “coming soon”.  Since these tools are not yet fully defined, their descriptions remain high level.  We emphasised their connection to Atlas‑V and AtlasStudio and suggested potential use cases.  As the products evolve, the copy should be updated to reflect real features and timelines.

## Future refinements

* **Voice adjustments** – If the target audience shifts (e.g. from developers to end users), we may need to simplify technical terminology or add more emotive language.
* **Localization** – Currently the copy assumes an English‑speaking audience.  For a broader launch, translations should be handled by native speakers to preserve nuance.
* **SEO** – We did not optimise for search engines; keywords such as “interactive maps” or “game engine” could be incorporated into meta descriptions when the site goes live.

These notes capture the context behind the writing and offer guidance for future copy iterations.
